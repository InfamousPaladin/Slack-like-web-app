# Assumptions
## auth.py



## channel.py



channel_messages assumptions:
start in an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0
token has already been generated previously
channels_create adds user that creates it in to the channel


If no messages have been made in a channel, then the start value will be 0 but the end value will be -1.
