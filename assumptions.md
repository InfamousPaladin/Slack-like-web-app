- Newly created channel automatically adds the user who created it and sets them as owner.
- Channel name length has to be between 1-20 characters inclusive. 
- Only logged in users are able to create channels. 
- Only users that are logged in are able to list channels (Both the users are a part of and not).
- Can't assume that created channels are going to be listed in order of creation.
- Can list both private and public channels.
